In the age of social media, why start a blog? If you're quick with words, Twitter's for you. If you're ready to write a manifesto, Facebook is your stage. Prefer visuals or videos? Instagram and YouTube have you covered. The options are endless, but they all have one thing in common: they need your attention.

Time is the most precious resource I have. It defines who I am and who I will become. So, instead of mindlessly scrolling, I decided to invest my time in something that truly excites me‚Äîlearning to code.

Now, I'm proud to share my little corner of the web. Here, I'll post my thoughts, book recommendations, travel photos, and web development learnings, including code snippets that I hope will help others.

Welcome to my journey, I‚Äôm Aryan Swaroop!
